The game will be designed using an object oriented approach.

------------------------------------------- Design 1st iteration -------------------------------------------------------

Brain Storming:
A Shape class (base class): It'll contain the rotation functions, 
A class for each individual piece, this will inherit from the shape class.
A GameBoard class which holds the current representation of the board and is able to display it and update it on the fly.
A Random class that decides the next piece using a random number generator.
A new thread for input. I.e. the gameboard and the input need to run concurrently.
